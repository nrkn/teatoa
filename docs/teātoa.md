# Teātoa

![Teātoa](img/te%C4%81toa.jpg)

**Area**: 8.2ha

**Population**: 5,140 

**Population Density**: 62,583/km2

**Government Type**: informal governance

Though very small in area (8.2ha), Teātoa is remarkably diverse in terms of both 
people and resources. With a population of 5,140 and a population density of 
62,583 people per km2, it is the most densely populated of any Pacific island, 
with the next being Ebeye, at 40,000/km2

## Population

First settled by Lapita peoples, successive migrations have made Teātoa one of 
the most ethnically diverse islands in the Pacific. While the majority of 
immigrants came from first Western Polynesia and later Eastern Polynesia,
there were also influxes of people from Melanesia, Micronesia and South East 
Asia. In ~950 CE there was also a notable migration composing peoples 
from Madagascar (both Madagascy and Bantu), Sri Lanka and South India.

### Language

Classified as a Polynesian language, Teātoan is distinctive for having 
an unusually large number of synonyms for most words, and for having some
unusal words for everyday things when compared to its sister languages

Originally thought by outsiders to be a creole descended from Maritime 
Polynesian Pidgin, the bulk of the Teātoan vocabulary is clearly Polynesian in 
origin, with heavy influences from Micronesian and Melanesian languages, and 
a large number of loan words from Malagasy, India and Maritime South East Asia

Teātoan linguist Kau Kasi argues that the small handful of unusal words (mostly 
for everyday things) in the language have more in common with Proto-Oceanic 
reconstructions than they do with any other living Polynesian languages, and 
that they are remnants of an earlier base language, modified and simplified and 
expanded over multiple cycles with each incoming wave of migration 

### Religion

Teātoa is the last Pacific island to continue practising a traditional 
polytheistic religion, although there are also small communities of Christians
and Muslims, and even a handful of Buddhists - however, most of these also
follow traditional beliefs to a greater or lesser degree.

## Geography

Usually referred to by the inhabitants as a single island, it is actually 
composed of five smaller islands connected partly by lava flows. There were 
originally four - most of Makāfi was formerly just below sea level and is 
largely reclaimed land.

- Halasi
- Vaika
- Tūpu
- Kota Pey
- Makāfi

![Teātoa Map](img/te%C4%81toa-map.png)

Hala Siwi Rd and Teātoto Rd are built along ancient lava flows connecting the
four original islands together, along with a third outflow (Kota Rd) that joins 
to, and runs along the center of Makāfi (as Kuma Rd)

Teātoa's distinctive architecture often sees it referred to by outsiders as
"the Mediterranean in the Pacific" - however the resemblance is superficial, and
largely down to the terracotta roofing tiles used throughout the island. 

Halasi has more residential housing than all of the other islands combined. 
Teātoans can own neither land nor buildings, which are instead held in common, 
and they tend to move house every five or ten years. All houses are built in the 
same modular traditional style, with larger buildings reserved for community 
spaces.

### Halasi

![Halasi](img/halasi.jpg)

Halasi was once covered in the sandstone and limestone used to build most of 
Teātoa's structures, however much of it has been quarried out and only small 
pockets remain, with the exposed bedrock mostly built over. Some of the old 
quarries and mines below Halasi have been connected and join Halasi's waste 
water treatment system to the sea. A small desalination and waste water 
reclamation facility was added to the plant in 2015 as insurance against
drought.

Halasi is largely residential. Two of the more unusual streets are Api Lane
and Tupuk Street, where a series of old quarry and mine shafts below street 
level were turned into housing, traditionally occupied for short periods by 
students and young people who have yet to start a family. These areas are 
notorious for their all night parties.

One of the island's few large buildings, the council hall, is located at the end
of Hala Siwi Road. It is mostly used for meetings and administration.

### Vaika

![Vaika](img/vaika.jpg)

Vaika is an eroded rocky outcrop ringed by tidal pools and holding large 
reserves of fresh water in a lagoon at the center. Traditional aquaculture 
practises have gradually evolved into a modern aquaculture plant, raising a wide 
variety of both freshwater and marine plants and animals for domestic 
consumption and export.

### Tūpu

![Tūpu](img/tupu.jpg)

Tūpu is the remains of a sedimentary lake bed in an eroded crater, composed of 
rich topsoil covering clay. It is covered in terraced farms growing mostly root 
crops, tree crops and bamboo. 

The farms are supplied with water from a small central reservoir which is 
replenished in the rainy season, but following a series of bad years a small 
desalination plant was also added in 2013.

The Botanic Gardens are also located on Tūpu, showcasing a number of unusual
plants atypical to the climate growing in controlled conditions

### Kota Pey

![Kota Pey](img/kota-pey.jpg)

Kota Pey is the central island, composed mostly of lava overflow - most of the
island is taken up by Kota Market Square. One corner of the square is occupied
by the Kota Pey entertainment district, famous for its bars, restaurants and
for the game of skill played here, using a mechanical contraption 
(traditionally made of bamboo and rubber) similar to a Pachinko machine.

### Makāfi

![Makāfi](img/makafi.jpg)

Makāfi was originally a single thin lava flow (now Kuma Rd), however the 
surrounding waters were very shallow and a land reclamation project was 
undertaken in the 1960s to make room for light industry.

![Port and Ship Yard](img/shipyard.jpg)
*Port and Ship Yard*

It is the location of Teātoa's main sea port and ship yard. Administrative 
buildings for important groups like the Department of Fisheries (more like a 
guild than a government department) are also located here, on Kuma Road.

## Economy

Root crops, tree crops, aquaculture, fishing, textiles, crafts, jewelry, music,
arts and literature, tourism

## Public Services

### Government

Although Teātoa has an official government its role is largely ceremonial, for
diplomatic, sporting and trade purposes. Actual decisions are made largely 
through consensus at a grassroots level, through a complicated system of guilds 
(fishers' guild, potters' guild etc), community groups and important families. 

Occasional large meetings are held for decisions affecting the whole island, 
also by consensus, although on a handful of occasions it has come down to a vote 
when consensus could not be met. On these occasions, all inhabitants of the 
island vote, whether born there or not, including children over the age of 5.

### Education

Literacy on Teātoa is 99%. Education is highly valued, largely informal, and 
ongoing, with almost all adults having undertaken some university level papers. 
Although the island has a university, its physical campus is mostly used as a 
meeting space and library. Actual classrooms are spread around the island, with 
most classes (those not requiring special equipment) held in peoples' homes or 
public spaces.

### Health

The life expectancy at birth for women is 83.1 years, and 80.7 years for men.
Teātoa has a small, modern hospital located on Kota Pey.

# Sports

Although a variety of games and sports are played, the most important is the 
ball game

![Sports Fields](img/sports.jpg)

## Ball Game

Played on a flat field or court, usually roughly rectangular or square in shape,
or a looser version played in the alleys and streets

The size, shape and weight of the balls used differ considerably in traditional 
variants, but the most variants use a single round ball slightly smaller and 
slightly heavier than a soccer ball

There are two teams - each places a circular mat (about 3m in diameter) on the 
ground at opposing ends of the play field 

The starting team is decided a number of ways, but usually by age, with the team
containing the oldest member going first, or occasionally the team containing 
the youngest member

That person then picks the ball up, throws it in the air, and must make a pass 
by volleying the ball to another player with their hips, elbows or knees

The ball must stay in play using only those body parts until a point is scored 
or a catch occurs (in variants that allow catching and/or carrying)

While in play it can be intercepted, bounced off the ground or walls, caught in 
some cases (see below) but must not come to a stop on the ground while in a 
team's possesion

Points are scored in a number of ways depending on the variant, but generally:

- **1 point**: catching then carrying the ball (see below) past the opponents' 
  mat, on either side of the mat
- **2 points**: catching, carrying and placing the ball down on the opponents' 
  mat. The ball should be placed gently enough not to move the mat.
- **3 points**: sliding the opponents' mat by hitting it with the ball directly 
  off a volley from a certain distance, usually 1/2 or 1/3 of the playfield. If 
  the mat lifts off the ground at all when being struck by the ball rather than 
  sliding flat it is a foul. If the mat slides, it stays in the new location for 
  the duration of the game.

It is popular in short games to use only one point scoring method, and have it 
be always worth **1 point**

Players can only carry the ball if they catch it in mid air, with both feet off 
the ground. They can do this regardless of which side has possession. Once a 
player catches the ball they must land on their feet and can then either start 
a new volley, or attempt to score by carrying the ball or via one of the other 
scoring methods

In most variants the players cannot kick the ball with their feet, and they can
only touch it with their hands if they are:

- catching the ball in mid air
- carrying the ball after catching it
- starting a volley after catching it
- starting a volley after the opposing team commits a foul

A foul occurs when a player or team:

- loses their footing after catching or while carrying the ball
- breaks the hand/feet rule
- lets the ball stop on the ground
- fails to slide the mat
- fails to put the ball down on the mat 
- kicks the ball with their feet - although there are some popular variants 
  where kicking is allowed from a certain distance, usually close to your own
  mat

Most games are informal, with teams chosen using one of several traditional 
counting games, then a target number of points is agreed on according to how 
much time the players have. 

If some of the players have not played together before, they usually spend 
several minutes before the match discussing which rules and method of play to 
use.

In an informal game, scoring points from a distance generally works on an honour
system, with teams usually giving each other benefit of the doubt. Most minor
fouls are also often overlooked, particularly if normal play continues smoothly 
after the foul is made. 

Once a year, a formal tournament is played. Any person may register to enter, 
and the teams are chosen by lottery. A stricter, traditional set of rules are 
used, and markings are placed on the play field indicating the distances from
which various scores can be made.

Once every twenty years, a grand tournament is played. This uses a further
reduced set of rules (no carrying rules, no kicking), and is believed to be 
closer to the original form of the game.
